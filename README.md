```

5. **Note**: You may have to grant the CLI permissions to write, read, and delete on your system.
   - `icacls C:\Windows\System32\scout.exe /grant Everyone:F`

### Connect to Your Scout Account

Authenticate your local environment with:

```sh
scout link
```

This will securely connect your CLI to your **Scout account**.

### Initialize a Scout Project

To start a new Scout project in your local directory, run:

```sh
scout init
```

The CLI will walk you through the setup process.

### Run a Workflow

To run a specific workflow, use the following command:

```sh
scout workflows run <workflow_folder>
```

Replace `<workflow_folder>` with the folder name of the workflow you want to run

### Deploy a Workflow

To deploy a workflow, use the following command:

```sh
scout workflows deploy <workflow_folder>
```

## üìÅ AI Workflow Project Structure

A **Scout AI Workflows as Code** project follows a structured hierarchy:

```
/workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inputs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meta.ts
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.yml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inputs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meta.ts
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scout.config.ts
```

### **üîπ Key Components:**

- **`workflow.yml`** ‚Äì Defines each AI workflow.
- **`inputs/default.json`** ‚Äì Stores default input parameters for the workflow.
- **`meta.ts`** ‚Äì Metadata and additional configuration for the workflow.
- **`scout.config.js`** ‚Äì Configuration settings for your Scout project.

cd scout-cli
```

2. Install prerequisites:

- [Install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
- [Setup your development IDE environment](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/)

3. Now you should be able to run the code locally:

```bash
deno task dev --help
```

```bash
deno task dev workflows deploy --config ./examples/starter/workflows/source_mapping.yml
```

3. Now you should be able to use `scout` from your system! Trying running `scout --help` to see if it works.
4. If you want to remove the cli you can run `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/scout`.
